## learning-react

### This repo used to follow [the tutorial by Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/)

### Now I'm ~~messing around~~ experimenting with React using their [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

The working UI can be found [here](https://tsunderekermit.github.io/learning-react/), it's really ugly though :(

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
